Working at Indiana University was an amazing experience. I got a chance to interact and guide aspiring students, while learning along the way.

I was an Associate Instructor for the course 'Information Representation', wherein my primary duties included:
* Clarifying concepts such as Entity-Relationship Diagrams, its conversion into database tables and querying the database in MySql
* PHP and dynamic client server interactive web pages
* Web Development: HTML, JS, CSS, XML
