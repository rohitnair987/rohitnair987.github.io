Find a buddy to play with after work, dine on a weekend or even study!

* Built a web-based project that involves building of a multi-page website with forms, event registration, event creation and other such modules to help users find a friend or a group to take part in an activity or to host an event.
* AWS EC2: used to host the database

We designed a website for all the people in IU and Btown that are looking for hiking partners, travel companions, gym buddies, a group to study with or someone to play sports with during their free time. This website will help people away from their family or friends to connect with new people around with similar interests. Through this website, one can find people to join them for studies or other fun activities, or even attend an event happening in their locality, look at all the upcoming events happening during the week/day and plan their schedule accordingly. We also plan to add a section through which we can send timely notifications and reminders to the events people register in.
